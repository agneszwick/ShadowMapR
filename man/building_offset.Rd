\title{Compute the Shadow Offset for Each Building}
\usage{
building_offset(buildings)
}
\arguments{
\item{buildings}{sf object containing building geometries and attributes such as height, solar azimuth, and solar elevation.}
}
\value{
sf object containing buildings with an additional column `shadow_geometry` representing the calculated shadow polygons.
}
\description{
This function computes a shadow offset for each building in an `sf` object based on the building's height,
solar azimuth, and solar elevation. It applies a shadow vector of the correct length and angle to each corner
of the building, generating a new polygon that represents the shadow projection.
