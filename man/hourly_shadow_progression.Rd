\title{Run Interactive Shadow Map Application}
\usage{
hourly_shadow_progression(map_layer, date)
}
\arguments{
\item{map_layer}{A named list of sf objects for each hour, containing `buildings`, `shadows`,
and `sunlight` geometries in the respective coordinate system (usually WGS84, EPSG:4326).
Each element in the list corresponds to one hour of the day and contains the respective
data for that hour.}

\item{date}{A character string representing the date (e.g., `"2025-02-18"`), used in the title
of the Shiny application to indicate the date for shadow progression visualization.}
}
\value{
Launches a Shiny interactive map application. The application visualizes the shadow
        progression throughout the day, allowing the user to select different hours via a slider
        to see how shadows and sunlight areas change over time.
}
\description{
This function starts a Shiny application that allows users to visualize the progression of shadows
over a day. It takes precomputed map layers containing buildings, shadows, and sunlight areas,
and provides an interactive map where the user can view shadow changes at each hour.
