\title{Extract building data from an XML file}
\usage{
extract_xml_polygons(xml_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{xml_file}{Character string, path to the XML file containing building data}
}
\value{
Data frame containing extracted building data (building ID, part ID, geometry, height, and file name)
}
\description{
This function reads an XML file containing 3D building models LoD0 Germany (LoD0-DE),
extracts building data including geometry and measured height, and returns the data as a data frame.
The function extracts the geometry from `<gml:posList>` elements within `<bldg:Building>` and `<bldg:BuildingPart>` elements,
and the `measuredHeight` attribute from `<bldg:measuredHeight>` elements.
