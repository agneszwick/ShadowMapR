\title{Calculate the Shadow Points of a Building Based on Solar Position and Shadow Length}
\usage{
calculate_shadow_points(building, solar_pos, shadow_length)
}
\arguments{
\item{building}{sf object containing the geometry of a building (POLYGON geometry).}

\item{solar_pos}{Numeric vector of length 2, where the first element is the solar azimuth (in degrees)
and the second element is the solar elevation (in degrees).}

\item{shadow_length}{Numeric value representing the shadow length (in meters), calculated based on the building's height and solar elevation angle.}
}
\value{
sf object containing the shadow polygon geometry of the building.
}
\description{
This function calculates the shadow points of a building based on the solar position (azimuth and elevation)
and the shadow length. It takes an `sf` object containing the geometry of a building (POLYGON geometry),
the solar position, and the shadow length, and returns an `sf` object containing the shadow polygon geometry.
The function works by shifting the outline of the building in the direction of the shadow to create the shadow's corner points.
