\title{Calculate the shadow length based on building height and solar elevation angle}
\usage{
calculate_shadow_length(measuredHeight, solar_elevation_angle)
}
\arguments{
\item{measuredHeight}{Numeric value representing the measured height of the building (in meters).}

\item{solar_elevation_angle}{Numeric value representing the solar elevation angle (in degrees).}
}
\value{
Numeric value representing the shadow length (in meters).
}
\description{
This function calculates the shadow length of a building based on its height and the solar elevation angle.
The shadow length is calculated using the formula: shadow_length = height / tan(solar_elevation_angle).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example usage
height <- 10
solar_elevation <- 45
shadow_length <- calculate_shadow_length(height, solar_elevation)
print(shadow_length)
}
