\title{Calculate Shadow Geometry for Each Building}
\usage{
calculate_all_shadows(buildings)
}
\arguments{
\item{buildings}{sf object containing building geometries and attributes such as height, solar azimuth, and solar elevation.}
}
\value{
sf object containing buildings with an additional column `shadow_geometry` representing the calculated shadow polygons for each building.
}
\description{
This function calculates the shadow geometry for each building in an `sf` object based on the building's height,
solar azimuth, and solar elevation. It returns an `sf` object containing the buildings with an additional column
`shadow_geometry` representing the calculated shadow polygons for each building.
