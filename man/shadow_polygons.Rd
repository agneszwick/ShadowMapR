\title{Dissolve Shadow Polygons into a Single Geometry}
\usage{
shadow_polygons(buildings, batch_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{buildings}{An `sf` object containing building geometries. The `geometry` column should include
individual building polygons.}

\item{batch_size}{An integer value representing the batch size to process the shadow hulls in parts.}
}
\value{
An `sf` object with a single geometry representing the union of all shadow polygons.
}
\description{
This function processes building geometries, computes individual shadow hulls for each building,
and then dissolves multiple shadow polygons into a single unified geometry. The `st_union` operation
combines overlapping or adjacent shadow areas into one boundary, which is useful for visualizing
the overall shadow coverage in a region.
}
\details{
This function works in three steps:
1. It processes the building geometries to extract relevant features.
2. It computes the shadow hulls for each building (in batches if needed).
3. It dissolves all individual shadow polygons into a unified geometry using the `st_union` function from the `sf` package.

If no valid building geometries or shadow polygons are available, the function will raise an error.
The function assumes the existence of helper functions such as `process_buildings()` and `compute_shadow_hulls()`,
which should handle the relevant processing and computations.

# Example usage:
dissolved_shadow <- shadow_polygons(buildings_sf, batch_size = 10)
