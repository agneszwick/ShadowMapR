\title{Create a Map Visualizing Buildings, Shadows, and Sunlight Areas}
\usage{
create_shadow_map(building_sf, shadows, sunlight, time)
}
\arguments{
\item{building_sf}{sf object containing merged building polygons (e.g., `sf` object with the geometry of buildings).}

\item{shadows}{sf object containing shadow polygons (e.g., `sf` object with the geometry representing shadow areas).}

\item{sunlight}{sf object containing sunlight polygons (e.g., `sf` object with the geometry representing areas under sunlight).}

\item{time}{POSIXct object representing the time of day when the map is generated (this could be used for dynamic updates or time-based visualization controls).}
}
\value{
A `leaflet` map object with layers for buildings, shadows, and sunlight, along with a time control at the bottom-right.
}
\description{
This function generates an interactive map using the `leaflet` package to visualize buildings, shadows, and sunlight areas.
The map allows users to toggle between different layers for buildings, shadows, and sunlight areas.
The function also adds a time control in the bottom-right corner of the map, which could be used for dynamic time-based visualizations.
}
\details{
The `create_shadow_map` function provides a visual representation of buildings, shadows, and sunlight areas in a geographic region.
It allows users to interact with the map by toggling layers and exploring the spatial relationships between buildings and their shadows under different sunlight conditions.
The map is initialized at the centroid of the building polygons.

\dontrun{
# Assuming you have `sf` objects: building_sf, shadows, sunlight, and a time object.
create_shadow_map(building_sf, shadows, sunlight, Sys.time())
