\title{Precompute map layers for each hour}
\usage{
precompute_map_layers(solar_result, building_sf, batch_size = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{solar_result}{A list of solar results with names corresponding to hours (e.g., "2025-02-20 - 07:00").}

\item{building_sf}{An sf object containing building geometries.}

\item{batch_size}{Integer, the number of buildings to process in each batch.}
}
\value{
A named list of lists. Each inner list contains three sf objects:
  buildings, shadows, and sunlight.
}
\description{
This function precomputes the final map layers for each hour. For each hour, it:
  - Calculates shadow polygons and sunlight areas,
  - Unions all building geometries
}
