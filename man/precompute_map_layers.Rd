\title{Precompute Map Layers for Each Hour}
\usage{
precompute_map_layers(building_sf, shadow_polygons, sunlight_areas)
}
\arguments{
\item{building_sf}{An sf object containing building geometries. Each geometry should
represent a building or structure for which the map layers will be created.}

\item{shadow_polygons}{A named list of shadow polygons for each hour. Each element in
the list corresponds to shadow polygons for a specific hour.}

\item{sunlight_area}{A named list of sunlight areas for each hour. Each element in the
list corresponds to sunlight areas for a specific hour.}
}
\value{
A named list of lists. Each inner list contains three sf objects:
  \itemize{
    \item{buildings}{The union of all building geometries.}
    \item{shadows}{The shadow polygons for the specific hour.}
    \item{sunlight}{The sunlight areas for the specific hour.}
  }
  The outer list is named by the hour, corresponding to the input shadow polygons and sunlight areas.
}
\description{
This function precomputes the map layers for each hour, including building geometries,
shadow polygons, and sunlight areas. For each hour, it returns the corresponding
geometries and calculates the necessary map layers by merging the building geometries
with the shadows and sunlight areas.
