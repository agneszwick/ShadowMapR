# ShadowMapR
ShadowMapR allows users to **calculate and visualize building shadows** based on sunlight exposure and shadowed areas using **XML or GML data**.

## Key Features
Designed for **3D building models** in **LoD0** and **LoD2** formats from Germany (*LoD0-DE and LoD2-DE*), this package provides functions to:

- Process {.xml} or {.gml} files containing building geometries (*POLYGON*) and height information
- Compute centroids of building geometries
- Determine solar position (*azimuth and elevation*) using {suntools}
- Calculate building shadows for a specific time or generate an hourly shadow progression over a day
- Generate an interactive map displaying sunlight and shadow areas using {leaflet}

## Usage
Users can analyze shadows at specific times or visualize their evolution throughout the day, making it ideal for urban planning, solar analysis, and environmental studies.

âš  **Limitations:**
This package does not account for terrain elevation or vegetation shadows. It assumes all buildings are placed on a flat surface.



## Installation
