# ShadowMapR
ShadowMapR allows users to **calculate and visualize building shadows** based on sunlight exposure and shadowed areas using **XML or GML data**.

## Key Features
Designed for **3D building models** in **LoD0** and **LoD2** formats from Germany (*LoD0-DE and LoD2-DE*), this package provides functions to:

- Process `.xml` or `.gml` files containing building geometries (*POLYGON*) and height information
- Compute centroids of building geometries
- Determine solar position (*azimuth and elevation*) using `suntools`
- Calculate building shadows for a specific time or generate an hourly shadow progression over a day
- Generate an interactive map displaying sunlight and shadow areas using `leaflet`

## Usage
Users can analyze shadows at specific times or visualize their evolution throughout the day, making it ideal for urban planning, solar analysis, and environmental studies.

âš  **Limitations:**
This package **does not** account for **terrain elevation** or **vegetation shadows**. It assumes all buildings are placed on a **flat surface**.


## Installation

### From GitHub 
```r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("agneszwick/ShadowMapR")
```
## Example
```r
#Load package
library(ShadowMapR)

# Define file path
file_path <- "path/to/your/xml/or/gml/file"

# Extract crs of file
crs_code <- extract_crs(file_path)
print(crs)
# 25832 (e.g.)

# Process xml/gml file and create simple feature 
building_sf <- load_building_data(file_path, crs_code)

# Visualize building_sf in leaflet map
visualize_buildings(building_sf)
```
