Title: Create and Visualize Building Shadow Maps
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Agnes Zwick
Maintainer: Agnes Zwick <agnes.zwick@stud-mail.uni-wuerzburg.de>
Description: This package allows users to calculate and visualize building shadows,
    including sunlight and shadow areas, using XML data and geographical information.
    It is designed to work with 3D building models in LoD0 and LoD2 formats from Germany (LoD0-DE and LoD2-DE).
    The package provides functions to calculate the centroids of building geometries,
    determine the solar position for these centroids, and visualize the resulting shadow maps.
    Users can calculate the shadow cast for specific times or generate an hourly progression of shadows over a day.
    Additionally, the package includes tools for visualizing the shadow maps using the `leaflet` package.
    This package doesn't account for terrain or vegetation shadows. It assumes the buildings are all placed on a flat surface.
